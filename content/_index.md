I like doing useful stuff. Some things I've done:

### SWE

- Low-level optimizations (C++) for self-driving cars at [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex_self-driving_car).

### Drug Discovery

- Led drug discovery programs. Developed a selective VEGFR-3 inhibitor for Papillary Thyroid Cancer ([poster at ASCO 2025](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.16_suppl.3104)).
- Developed the open-source ML drug discovery tool [LoHi-Splitter](https://github.com/SteshinSS/lohi_splitter) (now merged into [Splito](https://splito-docs.datamol.io/stable/)).

### Aging Research

- Co-founded the largest online community of computational aging researchers, [computeage.org](https://computage.org/).
- Co-authored an [online textbook](https://computationalaginglab.github.io/computational_aging_course/intro.html) on computational aging and a PhD/MSc lecture course at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology.
- Increased the lifespan of [C. elegans worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans) at [Gero](http://gero.ai/).

### AI Research

- Published a methodological [NeurIPS paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/cb82f1f97ad0ca1d92df852a44a3bd73-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html).
- Taught the [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.abi.am/training/introduction-to-machine-learning) course at the Armenian Bioinformatics Institute.
- [Paper at JCIM 2025](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00743) on AI applied to find new LRRK2 ligands for Parkinson's disease.
- Reviewer for NeurIPS, Nature Communications.

### Competitions

- Captain of the team that placed 1st in the [International Data Analysis Olympiad 2021](https://idao.world/) among 650 teams in the online round.
- Organized the [largest BioML competition](https://newsroom.aua.am/2024/10/24/aua-armenias-largest-bioml-hackathon/) in Armenia.

### Other

- Holder of UK Global Talent visa.
- Blog post ["Better benchmarks for ML Drug Discovery"](https://portal.valencelabs.com/blogs/post/better-benchmarks-for-ml-drug-discovery-dMSYmfwHOgoaNhy).
